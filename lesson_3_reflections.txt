When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Maybe when you want to collaborate, or share your work, with others. The remote repository might even be used as a kind of backup for your local files and commit history.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It might be that changes made in the remote repository are made by another person, a collaborator, and that perhaps you don't want those changes in your local files without you checking them out and approve.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used when cloning files or repositorys on GitHub, between users for example. Clones are made when copying files or repositorys from GitHub to your local repository. You can clone forks in this manner also, to your computer.
