When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Maybe when you want to collaborate, or share your work, with others. The remote repository might even be used as a kind of backup for your local files and commit history.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It might be that changes made in the remote repository are made by another person, a collaborator, and that perhaps you don't want those changes in your local files without you checking them out and approve.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used when cloning files or repositorys on GitHub, between users for example. Clones are made when copying files or repositorys from GitHub to your local repository. You can clone forks in this manner also, to your computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that git (and you) know the relationship between the state of the remote repository and the state of the local one. Are they in-sync, are there changes, commits, made in the remote that hasn't been made locally, or vice versa. This is important so that git knows potential differences between versions, what can and can't be done, if there are conflicts that needs to be resolved before merging for example. It can also be good to have a copy of the latest remote state if you need to work off-line.
